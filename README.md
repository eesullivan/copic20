# COP Project
Project for the ConocoPhillips Innovation Challenge 2020 (Winning Submission)

## Hackathon Overview
Given two days (20 hours total), the project was to create a machine learning model as well as a front-end product to interact with the model.

### Final Product
My group of two decided to use a dataset from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/calcofi) to create a model that predicts salinity values.
The model was generated through KNIME, and our resulting linear regression model had an r-squared value of 0.8287.
For our front-end product, we used a bootstrap template (https://startbootstrap.com/templates/scrolling-nav/) and javascript to integrate our model.
Images of our result are in the folder 'Product'.
